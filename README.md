# Heat Transfer Projects

## English

Repository with coding projects for the Heat Transfer course at Universidad de los Andes. This repository has been modified by the author to reflect some further extensions and modifications that were posteriorly performed.

The repository encompasses three projects:

1. **Project 1 - Automated design of a fin:** This project consists of a simulation of the heat profile and efficiency of a heat dissipating fin, which has some given geometric constraints. The program uses a gradient descent method as a means to maximize fin efficiency and then plots the evolution of this optimization process.
2. **Project 2 - Simulation of the heat profile in a mechanical component:**
3. **Project 3 - Simulation aided design of a refrigeration system:**
